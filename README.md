- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Animations:** [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/)
- **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)

## ✨ Features

- **Cinematic Intro:** High-impact hero section with background video/imagery.
- **Smooth Animations:** Complex timeline sequences using GSAP for text reveals, image parallax, and scroll-triggered effects.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using Tailwind's utility classes.
